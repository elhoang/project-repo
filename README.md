Hello! My name is Emily Hoang and I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 

This repository is used to store all of my projects code. 
Note: this repository is public because I intend to share my personal work and my journey into engineering with everyone ;).

You can view my projects by visiting the "pull requests" section. 
Also, this is my first time using github so I'm still learning!
